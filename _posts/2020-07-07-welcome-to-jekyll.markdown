一番摸索之后终于用 Jekyll 搭成此静态博客。此事想了三个月，实际从着手到完成只用一天时间，期间还考查了 Swift static site generator [Publish](https://github.com/johnsundell/publish)，有些麻烦还是放弃。还是选择了最成熟的方案，看了一套[视頻教程](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB)，然后解决了几个技术障碍，赶在零点前上线，还算顺利。我只想有地方可以安静的表达，暂时用不到更多高级功能。此默认主题简洁清新，基本功能完整，应该会用相当一段时间。

完成这件事带来一些成就满足感。I can really use some good feelings.

今日之前日志都是过去在别处所写文章，选择一部分放到这里。

以下为默认生成的第一篇日志原文:

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
